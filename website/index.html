        These items have been proposed for ratification and require at least 65% YES votes in order to be put on the ballot for voting.  Voting is tallied 200 blocks after the specified block height.

    <div id="open">
        These items are active ballot proposals which are available for voting on.  In order to pass, the item must receive (A - 85% YES vote if the proposal requires a change to consensus, B - 75% YES vote if the proposal requires a change to voting rules or C - 66% YES vote for any other change.)   Voting is tallied 200 blocks after the specified block height.  The Dynamo Foundation will make a good faith effort to effect the change specified in the proposal as soon as practical after its passage but there is no guarantee that any specific proposal can or will be implemented.
